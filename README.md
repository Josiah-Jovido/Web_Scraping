# Web_Scraping
Web scraping is the process of collecting and parsing raw data from the Web, and the Python community has come up with some pretty powerful web scraping tools.
The Internet hosts perhaps the greatest source of information—and misinformation—on the planet. Many disciplines, such as data science, business intelligence, and investigative reporting, can benefit enormously from collecting and analyzing data from websites. Web scraping is an automated method used to extract large amounts of data from websites. The data on the websites are unstructured. Web scraping helps collect these unstructured data and store it in a structured form. There are different ways to scrape websites such as online Services, APIs or writing your own code.

#### In this repo i showed how to:
* Implement web scraping with python. 
* Parse website data using string methods and regular expressions.
* Parse website data using an HTML parser.
#### How Do You Scrape Data From A Website?
When you run the code for web scraping, a request is sent to the URL that you have mentioned. As a response to the request, the server sends the data and allows you to read the HTML or XML page. The code then, parses the HTML or XML page, finds the data and extracts it. To extract data using web scraping with python, you need to follow these basic steps:
* Find the URL that you want to scrape
* Inspecting the Page
* Find the data you want to extract
* Write the code
* Run the code and extract the data
* Store the data in the required format
